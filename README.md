NOTE: This is not a valid version whatsoever I 'm just trying out the github repos. The proper code will be updated in a couple of weeks.
This is a simple html page collection for an old factory complex (now working as a cultural venue).
The idea is, for each building in the complex there is a QR code next to it, redirecting the user to the matching webpage.
In this webpage there is a custom js mp3 player providing info for each building, like a virtual tour.
Most pages have photos in a gallery section located in the bottom of the page.
